# MQTT ESP32 Project
This project demonstrates communication between two ESP32 devices using the MQTT protocol. One ESP32 acts as a publisher, sending simulated data, while the other functions as a subscriber, receiving and displaying this information.

## Folders

- **MQTT_Publisher**: Contains the code for the ESP32 that publishes simulated data (voltage, current, and temperature of a battery) to an MQTT broker.
- **MQTT_Subscriber**: Contains the code for the ESP32 that receives and displays the data published by the MQTT_Publisher.
